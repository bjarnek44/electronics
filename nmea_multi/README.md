Overview
--------

This folder has tools for NMEA 0183 and 2000 reception to a Raspberry
Pi. The sub-folders are:

  * ``doc``: Some slightly out of date documentation.

  * ``pic``: Assembler code for the PIC16F1705 that does the NMEA 0183
    multiplexing.

  * ``rpi``: Programs to run on the Raspberry for reading and
    demultiplexing the NMEA 0183 data, as well as a configuring of the
    NMEA 0183 part of the multiplexing.

The PCB design is not yet committed to GitHub, but it is on its way.
